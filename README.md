# Exploring the Relationship between COVID-19-and-Air-Quality in NYS

# Advanced Visualization Tools - Final Project

## Methods
After downloading all datasets, open Tableau (version ```2021.4``` was used in this project). Connect the ```covid_cases.csv``` dataset to all the AQI datasets for each pollutant using ```Date``` and ```County``` as the relationships.

### Dashboard: Cases Map

### Dashboard: AQI Map
To create the ```AQI Map``` dashboard, several worksheets were used. Each sheet contained the AQI information on a map for each pollutant. This was done to show the pollutant-specific data for each county that was included in their respective dataset, since not every county was measured for each pollutant. In each sheet, a map
of NY was generated using ```county``` as a geo dimension. The AQI value was changed to ```average``` instead of the default ```sum```, since the average values would better represent the data. The AQI values for each respective pollutant was utilized as mark via color. ```Month``` and ```County``` were used as filters so that users could have the option to choose which information to see, similar to the ’Cases Map’ dashboard. Another dimension was added as a filter: ```Display Sheet.``` This filter was generated by creating a parameter, in which the respective sheet was added as an option. This was repeated for the other pollutants and their respective sheets as well, so that the ```Display Sheet``` filter dropdown menu in the dashboard would contain seven options: ```All,``` ```CO,``` ```NO2,``` ```Ozone```, ```PM2.5```, ```PM 10,``` and ```SO2```. Thus, the different pollutants could be seen in one dashboard, and users have the option to select a specific pollutant’s sheet to view its corresponding AQI values for each county.

### Dashboard: AQI Per County

### Dashboard: AQI vs Case Count
The number of cases and average AQI values for each month in 2020 were set side by side in six bar graphs from six sheets as seen in the dashboard. These six sheets were created using the parameter ```Select a Pollutant``` as a filter, following the same steps in creating the ```AQI Map``` dashboard above. Blue was used to signify the AQI values, while red illustrated the count of cases. For each bar graph, the AQI value for each pollutant was used as a row value and marked with a blue color.
